We need [psexec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) from [sysinternals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/) to use this trick. Use case, we are got standard user, we need to run some script as admin frequently. You can put this script below into aliases but that will expose your administrator password into plain text. Use with caution.

`psexec -user admin -p theLongAndComplexAdminPasswordWeHateToWriteManually%$123 "cmd"`
