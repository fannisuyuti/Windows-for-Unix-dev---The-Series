## Background
After around 3 years using mac and ubuntu, getting cozy with the zsh and ohmyzsh there. Then come back to windows 10 just to found out that developing software without proper terminal is a doom. ~Let's hope I have the spirit to continue the series, lol~.


_ps. open for suggestion, anything to make life easier while using windows will be good._
