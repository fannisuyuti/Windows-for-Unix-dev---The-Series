If your user account doesn't have admin privilege, and you want to run a program as an admin eg run Service Management or Editing System Environment Variable etc. This is quite annoying if everytime you need to run an app you must fill in the admin detail.

1. _(Optional)_ add alias for the command (to edit environment variable make alias like msenv.bat => `rundll32.exe sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables`
2. Open one single cmd as administrator, fill in the admin detail, use this cmd as application launcher by calling the aliases we made before.
3. voila, you dont have to put any confidential everytime you need to run something as admin
